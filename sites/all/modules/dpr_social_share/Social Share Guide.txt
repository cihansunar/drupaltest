To test locally

1. Make local.host Point to Your Computer

First thing you need to do is (as answered in the first link), facebook won't take localhost as a valid callback site, because it confuses localhost with a top level domain (com org etc.) in other words there is not dot . in your domain name. So change your /etc/hosts to add the entry

127.0.0.1   local.host
Now youcan access your app at http://local.host/... (this will take effect as soon as you save /etc/hosts file, no need to restart anything)

2. Add local.host as the Site URL on the facebook Dev Console

The second thing you need to do is add local.host as the site url on the facebook page

Now don't use your production app. Add a dummy app on your https://developers.facebook.com account Because your production app will have to set the site URL to your production URL and not local.host

Configure the dummy app as shown in the screenshot. But that website section(shown in the screenshot) won't be visible on the Basic settings page from the beginning.

First you will have to click + Add Platform button at the bottom, and select Website.




<?php module_load_include('php', 'dpr_social_share', '/templates/entry-point.tpl'); ?>

Then initialize it via javascript with this parameters at least:

<script type="text/javascript">
    (function ($) {
        $(function(){
           
        });
    }(jQuery));
</script>


3. To overwrite background color of popover according to specific project color code, add following code to main scss file

.socialmedia-popover{
    background-color: $<color name> !important;
    .arrow{
        border-bottom-color: $<color name> !important;
    }
}
